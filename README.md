# PROJECT GOAL

Here we have implemented **Linear and Generalized Linear Models from Scratch without using SKLearn inbuilt Package**, Each and every concept has been implemented by its Mathematical Logic. 

# Project Motivation

After Learning Machine Learnings Concepts and it Mathematics i have implemented various projects, but till now i didn't tried to implement the whole algorithm manually, so i decided to implement it mannualy without using SKLearn inbuilt package.

# Requirements Installation

**The Code is written in Python 3.7. If you don't have Python installed you can find it here. If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip. To install the required packages and libraries, run this command in the project directory after cloning the repository**

    pip install -r requirements.txt
